# android+xml architecture

Overview

This Android application architecture is designed to streamline the development of Kotlin and XML-based projects, providing a robust foundation for building scalable and maintainable applications. Leveraging Dagger for dependency injection and incorporating an In-App Purchase (IAP) class for seamless integration, this architecture follows a well-defined package structure and coding practices to enhance code organization and readability.

Package Hierarchy

data:
The data package is dedicated to data processing, encompassing classes responsible for fetching data from local databases, making API calls, and handling various data-related operations. This centralized location ensures a clean separation of concerns, making data management modular and easy to maintain.

di:
The di package houses all Dagger-related implementations, including dependency graphs, components, and modules. By adopting Dagger for dependency injection, the architecture promotes a modular and scalable approach to managing dependencies, facilitating efficient testing and easier code maintenance.

exception:
Within the exception package, custom exception classes are defined. This helps in creating a standardized and consistent approach to handling exceptional scenarios, improving code reliability and error management throughout the application.

session:
The session package is dedicated to managing shared preferences data. This centralized approach ensures a clear and organized way of storing and retrieving session-related information, promoting consistency in data storage practices.

ui:
The ui package serves as the umbrella for various sub-packages, each catering to different aspects of the user interface.

activity: Contains classes related to app activities.
fragment: Houses fragments for modular UI components.
adapter: Includes adapters for RecyclerViews and other UI components.
viewmodel: Stores ViewModel classes responsible for handling UI-related logic.
view: Houses custom views and UI components for reuse.
This modular structure promotes a clean and organized approach to UI development, making it easier to manage and extend the user interface components.

utils:
The utils package encapsulates utility classes used across the application. This includes custom views, common implementations, extension functions, and constants. By centralizing these utilities, the architecture encourages code reusability and ensures a consistent coding style throughout the project.

Coding Standards

The architecture adheres to standard coding practices, promoting readability, maintainability, and scalability. Consistent use of Dagger for dependency injection ensures a clean separation of concerns, making the codebase more modular and testable. Additionally, the inclusion of an In-App Purchase (IAP) class simplifies the implementation of in-app purchases, providing developers with an efficient and standardized solution.

By following this architecture, developers can expedite the development process, ensure code consistency, and build robust and scalable Android applications.

Feel free to customize this description according to the specifics of your added modules and implementations.

# Editing this README

When you're ready to make this README your own, just edit this file and use the handy template below (or feel free to structure it however you want - this is just a starting point!). Thanks to [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/) for this template.

## Suggestions for a good README

Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.

## Name
Choose a self-explaining name for your project.

## Description
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
