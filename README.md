# AndroidAKxml

Overview

This Android application architecture is designed to streamline the development of Kotlin and XML-based projects, providing a robust foundation for building scalable and maintainable applications. Leveraging Dagger for dependency injection and incorporating an In-App Purchase (IAP) class for seamless integration, this architecture follows a well-defined package structure and coding practices to enhance code organization and readability.

Package Hierarchy

data:
The data package is dedicated to data processing, encompassing classes responsible for fetching data from local databases, making API calls, and handling various data-related operations. This centralized location ensures a clean separation of concerns, making data management modular and easy to maintain.

di:
The di package houses all Dagger-related implementations, including dependency graphs, components, and modules. By adopting Dagger for dependency injection, the architecture promotes a modular and scalable approach to managing dependencies, facilitating efficient testing and easier code maintenance.

exception:
Within the exception package, custom exception classes are defined. This helps in creating a standardized and consistent approach to handling exceptional scenarios, improving code reliability and error management throughout the application.

session:
The session package is dedicated to managing shared preferences data. This centralized approach ensures a clear and organized way of storing and retrieving session-related information, promoting consistency in data storage practices.

ui:
The ui package serves as the umbrella for various sub-packages, each catering to different aspects of the user interface.

activity: Contains classes related to app activities.
fragment: Houses fragments for modular UI components.
adapter: Includes adapters for RecyclerViews and other UI components.
viewmodel: Stores ViewModel classes responsible for handling UI-related logic.
view: Houses custom views and UI components for reuse.
This modular structure promotes a clean and organized approach to UI development, making it easier to manage and extend the user interface components.

utils:
The utils package encapsulates utility classes used across the application. This includes custom views, common implementations, extension functions, and constants. By centralizing these utilities, the architecture encourages code reusability and ensures a consistent coding style throughout the project.

Coding Standards

The architecture adheres to standard coding practices, promoting readability, maintainability, and scalability. Consistent use of Dagger for dependency injection ensures a clean separation of concerns, making the codebase more modular and testable. Additionally, the inclusion of an In-App Purchase (IAP) class simplifies the implementation of in-app purchases, providing developers with an efficient and standardized solution.

By following this architecture, developers can expedite the development process, ensure code consistency, and build robust and scalable Android applications.
